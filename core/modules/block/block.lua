-- Blocks store a chunk of project configuration, tied to a condition indicating under what
-- circumstances the configuration should be applied, and an operator indicating whether the
-- values contained by the block are to be added or removed from the final result.
--
-- For performance, this module is just a thin wrapper over Lua tables. It does not define
-- a format `Block` type.

---
-- Does this block support storing or removing values? To enforce order of operations, each
-- blocks either contains values to be added to the state, or removed. Blocks can then be
-- combined in order to get the target state.
--
-- @param operation
--    The target operation, one of `Block.ADD` or `Block.REMOVE`.
